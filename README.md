# Voultify — Frontend (Vite + React starter)

This is a starter frontend scaffold for **Voultify** (a Google Drive-like app) with a dark violet branding.

## What's included
- Vite + React
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS (configured)
- lucide-react icons
- Simple component layout: Sidebar, Topbar, Pages, Modals
- Branded gradient (violet → blue) and placeholders for your backend integration

## How to run locally (step-by-step)
1. Extract the zip and open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the local dev URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Notes
- The UI is fully frontend-only. Hooks that will later call your backend are marked as TODO in code.
- Replace `src/assets/logo.jpg` with your preferred transparent PNG/SVG to improve rendering.
